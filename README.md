# Automatic co-occurrence generation using Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linking in Dutch Woo Document

## Abstract
Co-occurrence networks are used to represent (potential) relationships between terms, such as named entities, within a domain. Automatically generating such networks from text remains a challenging task. There already exists robust techniques for doing Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) in text documents. This study proposes a full pipeline for recognizing persons, organization, locations, and laws in Woogle, a search engine for open Dutch government documents, to automatically generate co-occurrence networks for these entity types. The findings demonstrate that the developed pipeline can recognize entities with an f1-score of 0.7, while the EL component achieves a micro f1-score of 0.74, leaving further room for improvements. This paper also showed some evaluations of the co-occurrence networks that have been created.
